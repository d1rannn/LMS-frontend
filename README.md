# New version of repo. Please, just discover, not copy. Thanks ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶
Old version is dead. Because of me. (Hate git in vscode now)

### To-Do

1. add course pic (backend endpoint + render on frontend)
2. on module edit page add delete module feature
3. fix progress tracking (move it on localstorage or redux storage and fix backend endpoint (when teacher or admin adds new module, on backend side number of all module doesnt changes and it provides wrong percentage render))

### Done:

1. security of pages
2. font change
3. in user and student pages design changes
4. "in edit course page, separate modules and course info editing"
